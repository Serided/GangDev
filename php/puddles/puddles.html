		<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
		<p>
			Hello! My full name is Jens Hansen.<br>
			The superior gamer, I've been popping off in all of your favorite video games since you were a wee kid.<br>
			My current video games are Fortnite, Minecraft, League of Legends, and Valorant.<br>
			Recently, I have been getting into Factorio and Satisfactory.<br>
			Favorite food has <u>GOT</u> to be donuts. Those rings of perfection are my go-to for anything: meals, snacking, and wedding luncheons.<br>
			Favorite general activities are coding,
			<a href="/php/jens/jensGaming.php" class="hidden-link">gaming</a>,
			<a href="/php/jens/jensTheories.php" class="hidden-link">theorizing</a>, and
			<a href="/php/jens/jensGettinBuff.php" class="hidden-link">working out</a>. I get those gains and then I rapidly lose them.<br>
			I am toxic so don't kill me in Fortnite or I <u>WILL</u>
			<a href="/php/jens/jensRoastin.php" class="hidden-link">call you trash</a>. Even if you are better.<br>

                    Basically "Buy Me A Coffee" but you buy yourself a lemonade and we use the remaining money to make coding profitable.
                    This also gives us a chance to get out of our chairs and drive around town (delivering the lemonade). All around dubs.

                While these services are legit, it is a negotiation between the customer and the seller, as opposed to an official business.<br>
                Currently, nothing is available at a set price.
